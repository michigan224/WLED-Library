# Weather Responsive LEDs

Utilized the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display the current weather conditions in a responsive LED display. LED software [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/json-api/) was used on custom LED lightbars in my bedroom.

The LED changes color and pattern based on the current weather conditions.
